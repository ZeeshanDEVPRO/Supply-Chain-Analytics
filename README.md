## ðŸ§ª Dataset Overview

The project uses multiple CSV datasets related to:

- **Customers** â€“ customer IDs, locations, etc.
- **Orders** â€“ order dates, delivery times, etc.
- **OrderItems** â€“ products purchased per order
- **Payments** â€“ payment methods, statuses, and values
- **Products** â€“ product categories and IDs

> ðŸ“‚ These files are expected to be in the same working directory as the notebook.

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading
Loaded datasets using Pandas and verified structure with `.info()` and `.head()`.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed missing and duplicate entries
- Converted data types (dates, strings)
- Merged tables using keys (`customer_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed order frequency and delivery times
- Identified top-selling products and revenue contributors
- Visualized customer segmentation and regional trends using:
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` heatmaps, countplots, histograms

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Calculated metrics like:
  - Order delivery time
  - Payment value per product
  - Order frequency per customer

### 5. Machine Learning (optional/ongoing)
- (Add if applicable) Built a basic model for:
  - Predicting late deliveries or high-value customers
- Used:
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation
